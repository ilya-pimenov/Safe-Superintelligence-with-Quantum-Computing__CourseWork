## 1. What lessons can we learn from historical technological races (e.g., the nuclear arms race) to ensure superintelligence development is safe and collaborative?

Seemingly the most effective is buidling a non-zero sum narrative of ai advancement and focusing on the issues that benefit all of humanity. Current public ai leaders
ideally would understand the weight they have in creating the narrative in ai advancements. The higher level of inclusion of different nation states and public organization,
the higher chance we will have space to establish international treaties in regard to ai utilization and use of superintelligence.

## 2. How can we incentivize nations and companies to prioritize safety over speed in AI development?

One of the ways nations and companies can be incentivized to prioritize safety over speed in AI is to setup a globally recognized ISO like certification process
which would "green light" ai implementations in use in both public sector and bigger established companies, creating economic incentive to create ai that can be
commercially applied on a bigger scale (say, to build agents in aforementiond companies and institutions).

## 3. What role should international organizations play in coordinating global efforts to develop safe superintelligence?

International organizations can play central role in establishing a place for a dialog among all bigger ai players, while creating an open space for further ai 
developments. This open approach can potentially make it a non viable option to develop superintelligence in isolation. Analogy can be seen with ISS and the large 
hadron collider; where the effort of doing the same research in isolation makes it too much of a lift even for nation states. 

## Assignment

Write a brief essay (500-700 words) discussing the following:

• The potential dangers of an AI arms race.
• How SSI's "safety first" approach could address these dangers.
• Propose three specific strategies for fostering internation collaboration on AI safety.
