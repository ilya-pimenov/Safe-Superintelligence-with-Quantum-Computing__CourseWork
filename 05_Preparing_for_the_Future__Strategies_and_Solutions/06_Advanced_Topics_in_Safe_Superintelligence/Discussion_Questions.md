## 1. What are the biggest challenges in establishing global governance for AI?

A form of a prisoner's dillema, when one actor might decide for themselves to "one up" the others and rush forward to superintelligence, ignoring the safety protocols in the meantime; or having sub-optimical safety protocols that were designed in isolation without oversight.

## 2. How can nations balance their competitive interests with the need for collaboration?

I feel this have to be pre-dominantly resolved through advocacy of open platforms and international collaboration. Potentially also would've unite nations in understanding of the both opportunity and threat the superintelligence brings. In its dynamic, it might be not that different from us diretly confronting aliens. May be we will create the aliens outselves and superinteligence be that alien to the "old way" of things?

## 3. What role should companies like SSI plau in shaping international AI policies?

Being glue in the public forum on safety and development of superintelligence and establishing itself as a leader in the field, which would aid being glue.
